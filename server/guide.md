Leaflet: AI-Powered Documentation Generator.

Leaflet is an intelligent documentation engine that transforms raw source code into clear, human-friendly documentation instantly.

For decades, documentation has been the most neglected part of the software development process. It's time-consuming, repetitive, and often skipped entirely. This leads to poor onboarding, technical debt, and lost productivity across teams and projects.

Leaflet solves this with a powerful layer of generative AI that reads your code like an engineer would, understanding structure, logic, and intent, and automatically generates meaningful documentation: from inline comments and function explanations to README files and developer guides.

The Problem:
Developers hate writing documentation, it's often seen as a chore.

Yet, poor documentation slows onboarding, increases bugs, and drives up long-term maintenance costs.

Traditional tools are static, template-based, and fail to adapt to the nuance of modern codebases.

The Solution:
Leaflet leverages google gemini AI to provide context-aware, customizable, and developer-friendly documentation.

It doesnâ€™t just describe what the code does; it helps explain why itâ€™s written that way. It tailors documentation based on the style of the project, the framework, and the intended audience (developer, user, contributor).

ðŸ”§ Core Features
Autogeneration of docs for JS/TS, React, Node, and more â€” including JSDoc, TSDoc, and full Markdown files.

Natural-language code explanations for onboarding or training.

Git-integrated workflows for documentation-as-you-commit.

Custom tone, format, and verbosity settings for startups, open-source teams, or enterprises.

What Sets Leaflet Apart
Built on contextual understanding, not just pattern matching.

Designed for developers, not just documentation teams.

Vision
Leaflet is more than a tool. itâ€™s a foundation for living documentation. In the future, it will integrate with CI/CD, knowledge bases, and code review tools to ensure teams always have up-to-date, explainable code, without sacrificing time or quality.

Leaflet is building the missing layer between developers and documentation â€” one thatâ€™s intelligent, contextual, and always up to date.
